You stand in front of a large, ornate desk.
You look into the drawers, but unfortunately each of them is empty.
You decide to take a better look at the desk and go around it looking in every place.
You spot a crevice into which someone has evidently slipped something thin and flat many times....
such as a knife or something similar. If only you had something like that with you!
What do you want to do?
