Last night in the pub must have gone very spontaneously.
You started with a beer, then had a shot of tequila, and the rest of the night....
Well the rest of the night you don't remember. You feel a terrible hangover, you don't want to open your eyes yet.
After lying down for a few minutes, however, you decide to open them. Wait a minute, something's not right here.
You wake up on the floor of a strange room, your heart starts beating way too fast, and you feel like you need to
get out of here.... you need to escape from this room!

Use 'describe' command - this will show you some places where you can go.
